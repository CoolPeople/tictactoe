### Repository
All of our code is kept track of in a git repository. The github link to the repository can be found [here]. All commits to the repository must be done via pull requests and either approved by someone else or integrated using travis. All code submitted must be tried and tested using TDD.

### Build scripts
For build scripts we use Gradle. Gradle allows us to run all tests when compiling our code. Gradle is ran through a shell. We recommend using the bash shell. For Gradle to be able to compile our code we first need to have the java development kit installed. Gradle should also handle all imported packages we are using in the project and download them from maven central.
